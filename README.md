# node-languagetool
This is a Node.js binding to the [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/) (LT)
spellchecker. It is based on a local instance of LT.
As it is a Java based framework, this binding will use
[node-jre](https://github.com/schreiben/node-jre/), which provides an embedded
local Java Runtime Engine.
