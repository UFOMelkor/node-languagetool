# node-languagetool
This is a Node.js binding to the [Language Tool](https://languagetool.org/)
spellchecker. It is based on a local instance of Language Tool. As Language Tool
is Java based, this binding will use
[node-jre](https://github.com/schreiben/node-jre/), which provides an embedded
local Java Runtime Engine.
